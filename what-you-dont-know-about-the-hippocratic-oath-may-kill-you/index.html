In 1964, the modern version of the Hippocratic Oath was written. It eliminates many of the safeguards for the patient and adds in responsibilities that are God’s alone. Let’s take a look at the differences and explore some of the subsequent and yet to come ramifications.</p><h3>First, do no harm?</h3><p>Nope. “First, do no harm” does not exist in either the original or the modern oath. The idea, though not the precise wording, of “First, do no harm” exists in the text of Hippocrates. This concept is alluded to in the original oath when it says: “With regard to healing the sick, I will devise and order for them the best diet, according to my judgment and means; and I will take care that they suffer no hurt or damage.” The concept of “First, do not harm does not appear in the modern oath.</p><p>I have used this term with my doctors who were advocating actions that I saw harm in. Not one of them said “That is not in the oath I took.”</p><h3>Modern doctors are one person death panels?</h3><p>Possibly. This is in the modern oath:</p><blockquote><em>“If it is given me to save a life, all thanks. But it may also be within my power to take a life; this awesome responsibility must be faced with great humbleness and awareness of my own frailty.”</em></blockquote><p>The “awesome responsibility” of taking a life must be faced with “great humbleness?” The taking of life and humility are antithetical. Taking a life is never humble, it is always placing someone or something or some idea ahead of that life.</p><p>Here are the seeds of the murder of humans in the womb. Here are the seeds of euthanasia. In fact, the modern oath deletes the original oath’s specific mention to not poison a patient or abort a pregnant woman:</p><blockquote><em>“Nor shall any man’s entreaty prevail upon me to administer poison to anyone; neither will I counsel any man to do so. Moreover, I will give no sort of medicine to any pregnant woman, with a view to destroy the child.”</em></blockquote><h3>Power to murder burdens on the family or society?</h3><blockquote><em>“I will remember that I do not treat a fever chart, a cancerous growth, but a sick human being, whose illness may affect the person’s family and economic stability. My responsibility includes these related problems, if I am to care adequately for the sick.”</em></blockquote><p>This sounds fantastic at first, that all doctors are treating a human being rather than battling a disease. It’s what comes next that is shocking. Doctors are called to weigh the affect of the illness on a person’s family and economic stability. Remember, they hold the power to take a life. It is not a far leap to see that the value of human life, according to this oath, is no longer sacrosanct to the individual, but instead an equation of the effect of their contribution or burden on their family (and by extension society), and the doctor is sworn to take this into consideration in how they treat the patient. The value of a human life is impacted, according to the modern oath, by the cost or contribution that person incurs on those around them. No longer is human life valuable because it is human life. Wow.</p><p>Humble Servant to the Patient vs. Arrogant Administrator for Society<br>The original oath has a spirit of humble service to the patient. It refers to entering the patient’s home “for the convenience and advantage of the patient.” It refers to serving the doctor who taught them their art, as well as their children.</p><p>The modern oath exudes a cold and calculating spirit in comparison with the original, as an administrator for the general health of family/society.</p><h3>Can a person of “good will” take the Modern Hippocratic Oath?</h3><p>I couldn’t. It is antithetical to care for the human person and their innate God-give value, meaning, and purpose. Yet this is the oath most doctors have taken since the mid 1960’s.
