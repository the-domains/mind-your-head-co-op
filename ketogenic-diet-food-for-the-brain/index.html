There are some things I have struggled to hold onto. Despite wanting oatmeal to work for me, I have discovered there is no way with current modern food production methods to duplicate the way oats need to be handled to make them part of my diet. For me, giving up wheat and other grains was not a big deal, but the oats hurt and I needed to be sure I could not make them work. I can’t. The science is a lot to follow, but the <a href="http://www.westonaprice.org/food-features/living-with-phytic-acid" data-href="http://www.westonaprice.org/food-features/living-with-phytic-acid">Weston A. Price Foundation explains why</a>, with the percent excerpt:</p><blockquote><em>“Oats contain very little phytase, especially after commercial heat treatment, and require a very long preparation period to completely reduce phytic acid levels. Soaking oats at 77 degrees F for 16 hours resulted in no reduction of phytic acid, nor did germination for up to three days at this temperature.63 However, malting (sprouting) oats for five days at 52 degrees F and then soaking for 17 hours at 120 degrees F removes 98 percent of phytates. Adding malted rye further enhances oat phytate reduction.64 Without initial germination, even a five-day soaking at a warm temperature in acidic liquid may result in an insignificant reduction in phytate due to the low phytase content of oats. On the plus side, the process of rolling oats removes a at least part of the bran, where a large portion of the phytic acid resides.<br> How do we square what we know about oats with the fact that oats were a staple in the diet of the Scots and Gaelic islanders, a people known for their robust good health and freedom from tooth decay? For one thing, high amounts of vitamin D from cod’s liver and other sources, helps prevent calcium losses from the high oat diet. Absorbable calcium from raw dairy products, consumed in abundance on mainland Scotland, provides additional protection.</em></blockquote><blockquote><em>In addition, it is likely that a good part of the phytase remained in the oats of yore, which partially germinated in stacks left for a period in the field, were not heat treated and were hand rolled immediately prior to preparation. And some Scottish and Gaelic recipes do call for a long fermentation of oats before and even after they are cooked.</em></blockquote><blockquote><em>Unprocessed Irish or Scottish oats, which have not been heated to high temperatures, are available in some health food stores and on the internet. One study found that unheated oats had the same phytase activity as wheat.65 They should be soaked in acidulated water for as long as twenty-four hours on top of a hot plate to keep them at about 100 degrees F. This will reduce a part of the phytic acid as well as the levels of other anti-nutrients, and result in a more digestible product. Overnight fermenting of rolled oats using a rye starter — or even with the addition of a small amount of fresh rye flour — may result in a fairly decent reduction of phytate levels. It is unclear whether heat-treated oats are healthy to eat regularly.”</em></blockquote></div></section></div><section id="3" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-light colors-local " data-reactid="44"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="45"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="46"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="47"><span data-reactid="48"><a href="index.html" class="m-r-1 m-b-1 v-a-m d-ib" data-reactid="49"><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/3c12c13d-3ccd-4f4d-991f-068715aa713b.jpg" class="h-2rem w-a" data-reactid="50"/></a><h2 data-reactid="51"><a data-reactid="52">Mind Your Head Co-op</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="53"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="54"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="55"><div class="Link" data-reactid="56"><a data-reactid="57">Deacon Patrick Jones</a></div></div></div></div><div data-reactid="58"></div></section></div></div>
