So while we survivors can share generalities and concepts, we’re on our own discovering the details.</p><p>On our own. Och! How many people fall away, run away, or slowly fade from our lives because of their ignorance of brain injury, including the oft rude way we treat them, not because of them, upon reflection, but because we are cornered, wounded animals being attacked from all sides by the bombardment of the world that no one sees and sometimes we attack those closest to us who are trying to help.</p><p>Then there is the ignorance of the medical world.

Oh! Our beloved caregivers — thank you and thank God for you! May we fill the holes in your arms anew and anew!</p><h2>Holes in our brain</h2><p>There are, of course, holes in how our brain works. Holes that swallow trains of thought, vast and sudden rents in the earth that open before us, erasing all hint of where we were going, what we were doing, or even who we are with. One moment running fast and true, the next standing on the edge of oblivion without a clue!</p><p>Holes in my head that really are there, but make no sense until one realizes light, sound, scents, touch, taste, sudden and startling are spears, axes, bombs and worse all dinging, denting, cleaving, flaying, and carving my brain, causing incredible pain, and all brain energy to drain int he span of a beat of the heart — al because a diesel truck drove by and decided to fart.</p><h2>Long term holes</h2><p>Holes that are pits or craters into which I am spit, and have to climb out of on walls that crumble at the slightest misstep, sending me careening back to the bottom yet deeper than before, all because of sensory overload or adrenaline’s hair trigger (which is always more twitchy when climbing the walls of a pit). </p><h2>Holes in my faith</h2><p>Holes that reveal to me and make it quite clear, I can’t believe my previous illusions that I can do this life stuff alone, and not succumb to fear! Instead I see plainly how essential God is and what wild abundance He gives me that I can do all that I do despite (and sometimes because of!) these holes!</p><h2>How ‘bout you?</h2><p>What holes do you experience as part of your TBI?
