### Denial: This is NOT happening to me! Stage 1 of 7

In its simplest form, denial finds us trying to convince ourselves that "this is not happening!" However, there are some very sly ways we can do this --- all of which are futile attempts at controlling reality. One example comes from my own experience.

For the first several months of my disabling TBI, I kept trying to will my symptoms away. I had had nearly twenty years of unknowingly willing various symptoms away (looking back, in reality I was ignoring or "cutting through" my symptoms rather than making them disappear) so I could live a normal life. I was quite successful at this, until the symptoms became to great to "cut through" or ignore due to my disabling concussion. I failed miserably, yet for some time was unwilling to acknowledge reality. I kept trying to will it away.

Reality, however, has a way of asserting itself and forcing us to acknowledge it. Typically when that occurs, we move into the next stage of grieving: Anger

**Fly Without Wings**  
02--01--2003  
_I wrote this at 2:30am after learning I had TBI and the damage was permanent. I tried to will my symptoms away. I was trying to deny the very reality of my disability, attempting to control it._

I have tried, desperately,  
to make this up.  
If I am, if I can,  
I can make it disappear.  
I am not and I can't.  
This is real and  
it is happening to us.

Not a nightmare, really,  
they are different:  
we wake up from them,  
their pain dissolves with  
consciousness --  
there is no waking up and  
reality is even clearer with  
consciousness.

So we face into the wind  
billowing forth upon this brink  
on which we stand  
and prepare to learn to fly  
without wings.
