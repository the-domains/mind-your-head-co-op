# About

## Deacon Patrick Jones

I am a Roman Catholic deacon serving in the [Diocese of Colorado Springs][0], Colorado. I live with my wife and our children on the slope of Pikes Peak.

I began Mind Your Head Co-op ministry to other with brain injury and their caregivers not long after I had my 8th concussion in 2002\. It was the proverbial straw that broke the camel's back, causing significant cognitive deficits, constant neurological vertigo, and variable brain fatigue due to sensory over stimulation.

I look forward to hearing from you!
