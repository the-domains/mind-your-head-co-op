## Co-Creating with God

Because we are made in God's image, we have the built in desire to help create God's vision by doing what we can to make the world a better place.

That may seem like quite a large task. It is. Our part in it is, however, quite manageable. Sometimes the hardest part is figuring out what our part is. "What does God want me to do?" is one of the tricky questions in life. It doesn't need to be. And being disabled may ironically free us to see the answer that has always been in front of our noses!

## What am I passionate about?

What am I passionate about? Where does my enthusiasm lie. What do I enjoy doing?

Answer these questions and you are well on your way to knowing what God wants you to do. After all, God made you and gave you those passions for a reason (however misguided they may have become!). But there is one thing that always is a part of what we are each called to do: build relationship.

## Building Relationship

Each of us is called to build relationships for they are what truly matter in life. Everyone of the Ten Commandments is about upholding right relationship. Healthy relationships help people become who God created them to be and this always leads to changes that are truly lasting and can literally change the world.

How you build relationship can be as varied as we are. It is usually profoundly simple things: being present with our children, our spouse, our close friends; volunteering to mentor a boy or girl; doing nothing, yet uniting our suffering with Christ's and serving as the light on the hill that can not be hidden. To often we define our lives by what we do rather than who we are. Who we are can have tremendous impact on others. Simply by how we choose to face adversity, others can discover hope, faith, love, and come to know who God is in their lives.

## My Cross

12--08--2003  
_"Take up your cross and follow me," says Jesus our Christ._

So this is my cross --- the gift of Jesus to his friends.  
How right they were to tell us this would be a long hard road.  
It is. Arduous. Barren. Bleak.

This cross is heavy and I can not put it down.  
I am merely a foolish pilgrim, making my way in the hope that  
The dawn from on high shall break upon me.  
That hope strengthens me, allows me to look around.  
On my journey I see tremendous grace.  
In my Beloved, as she gives so freely of herself,  
My wee daughters as they discover the wonder about them, within them,  
Our friends and community who help us day to day.  
Pilgrim's glimpses of what is yet to be.

This cross is no longer heavy,  
though the road is still long and hard.  
I am merry, lifted by this roadside grace.  
My feet lilt a jig, my breath pipes a tune.  
I am the merry foolish pilgrim conducting my God given  
errand ere I head for home.

God grant me always the grace of foolishness  
that I may see your grace boundless about me  
and joyfully travel this pilgrim's journey  
as I strive to be your hands and feet.  
Amen.  
--Patrick A. Jones
