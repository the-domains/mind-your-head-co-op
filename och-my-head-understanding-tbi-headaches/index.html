Stress increases our breathing, causing us to cast off too much CO2, required to exchange oxygen at a cellular level. By over breathing from constant stress, our body tries to protect us by swelling our sinuses. Unwittingly most of us get around this by breathing through our mouth. <a href="http://www.buteykocenterusa.com/">Buteyko Breathing</a> is the best way I know to learn how to breath properly all the time, eliminating sinus headaches completely.</p><h2>What’s Helped</h2><p>Here’s what’s worked for me (in no particular order), and the types of headaches I’ve found them effective against:</p><p>— dangling on <a href="http://www.mindyourheadcoop.org/blog/?p=447">my inversion table</a> as soon as I short circuit. Increases blood flow to my brain and helps relax the muscles. (All types)</p><p>— <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Navitas-Naturals-Organic-Chocolate-Cacao/dp/B001ELL9GI/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1293981095&amp;sr=8-1">Cacao Nibs</a>. Helps relax my head when it is recovering from implosion due to either muscle tension or adrenaline rushes.</p><p>— <a href="http://www.mindyourheadcoop.org/blog/?p=816">ResGrape red wine grape extract</a>. Increases blood flow by dilating blood vessels. Opens up my head and makes it feel far more normal than it has since before I became disabled 8 years ago.</p><p>— Barefoot running. My entire body moves better and more efficiently, my posture is improved, and my back, shoulders, and neck are far, far looser all the time. It increases blood flow, and releases the body’s natural healing that science does not understand but is beginning to know is there.</p><p>— Advil, taken in prescription dose (800 mg). as a muscle relaxant. This helps with the few tension headaches that I can’t treat in other ways.</p><p>— <a href="http://www.buteykocenterusa.com/">Buteyko Breathing</a>. Helps decrease the frequency and severity of muscle tension headaches, and eliminates sinus headaches all together.</p></div></section></div><section id="3" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-light colors-local " data-reactid="36"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="37"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="38"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="39"><span data-reactid="40"><a href="index.html" class="m-r-1 m-b-1 v-a-m d-ib" data-reactid="41"><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/3c12c13d-3ccd-4f4d-991f-068715aa713b.jpg" class="h-2rem w-a" data-reactid="42"/></a><h2 data-reactid="43"><a data-reactid="44">Mind Your Head Co-op</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="45"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="46"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="47"><div class="Link" data-reactid="48"><a data-reactid="49">Deacon Patrick Jones</a></div></div></div></div><div data-reactid="50"></div></section></div></div>
