For me, very few things in nature overstimulate me (though I do not hang out around loud water falls often). A field of wild flowers in morning dew at 10,000 feet the summer? Amazing scents! The vanilla-rum scent of a water hole from several miles away alluring me in to the shaded niche in the scorching desert till it was a veritable symphony of scents as I ran through the surrounding horsetails with various subtle changes? Delicious.</p></div></div></div></section></div><section id="15" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-white colors-local " data-reactid="217"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="218"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="219"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="220"><span data-reactid="221"><a href="index.html" class="m-r-1 m-b-1 v-a-m d-ib" data-reactid="222"><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/3c12c13d-3ccd-4f4d-991f-068715aa713b.jpg" class="h-2rem w-a" data-reactid="223"/></a><h2 data-reactid="224"><a data-reactid="225">Mind Your Head Co-op</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="226"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="227"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="228"><div class="Link" data-reactid="229"><a data-reactid="230">Mind Your Head Co-op RSS</a></div><div class="Link" data-reactid="231"><a data-reactid="232">Deacon Patrick Jones</a></div></div></div></div><div data-reactid="233"></div></section></div></div>

Keep these in and on for all interactions. The constant barrage of stimulation we can’t filter out grates on us, much like always listening to music you hate.

Turn around 20 times one direction, then 20 times the other direction while saying the alphabet backwards. We struggle to focus on anything we do, doing well to half task.
