            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Acceptance: Wow. This really is part of my life. Stage 5 of 7.</h1><p>Acceptance comes when we finally stop trying to change reality and we know that God is with us. The more we can experience God being with us, especially during the harder times, the easier it is for us to accept what we are going through.</p></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Raw, Primal Protective Reflex</h1><p>TBI anger is unlike any other kind of anger. It taps into our primal instinct to protect ourselves, like any wounded, cornered animal, with a burst of adrenaline. This is the source of the raw, primal strength, energy, focus, and coordination. Once it hits, it can not be stopped, only redirected in a safe direction.</p></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>First, do no harm?</h1><p>Though there are a rare few doctors whom I respect, I now know why the medical profession not longer deserves respect or high esteem. In 1964, the modern version of the Hippocratic Oath was written. It eliminates many of the safeguards for the patient and adds in responsibilities that are God’s alone. Let’s take a look at the differences and explore some of the subsequent and yet to come ramifications.</p></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Our Medical System: Acutely Brilliant, Chronically Inept</h1><p>If you have an acute medical issue, bones sticking out for example, our medical system is brilliant and providing the care you need. However, if you have a chronic, long term medical issue, such as brain injury, our medical system is no only inept but often harmful and incapable of recognizing either, blaming you instead. Let me explain…</p></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>One Year Stick Free!</h1><p>Barbara, my wife, tells it this way: “One year ago today (11–25–2012, this was first published, 2013) we got back from Mass on Christ the King and you asked me to watch you. You leaned your sticks against the garage and took off. My instincts from years of having to catch you when you fall had me diving. But you kept going. Down the road. Past the bridge. Out of sight. Tears streamed down my cheeks as I watched you go.”</p></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Ketogenic Diet: Food for the Brain</h1><p>Ketogenic simply means getting your primary energy by burning fat, as opposed to most people in the US today who get most of their energy by burning glucose. Science is showing us that when fat is our primary fuel we function much smoother and healthier — including multiple studies showing brain benefits of burning fat os our primary fuel. In essence we access God’s engineering by shifting to burning fat rather than glucose.</p></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Exercise Helps Heal the Brain</h1><p>Exercise really does help heal the brain. One of the now known ways it does is by helping generate new mitochondria in the brain and throughout the nervous system. When mitochondria, the powerhouse within each cell of the body, get low neurons risk dysfunction or death. Running the Colorado Trail, along with all other forms of exercise, help heal my brain. What exercise do you find helps heal yours?</p></article>]]></description>
