            <title><![CDATA[Adrenaline and Friends Half Life]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Adrenaline and Friends Half Life</h1><p>It was only a few years ago I began to understand more fully the extend of harm to my capacity adrenaline causes and just how long it takes to leave my system. I suspect most of us with bludgeoned brains feel the effects of adrenaline and friends (there is a slew of neurochemical stuff released that no one is really sure what all it does) without even realizing it for the simple reason that we are under constant bombardment from stimulation.</p></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Doctors, Doctors everywhere and not a one to see.</h1><p>Massive change in regulation as a result of Obamacare hit our nation on January first, 2014. Doctors are afraid, and they should be. So should their patients. I understand from a hospital board member that the penalty for a doctor’s first offense of not following the regulation is a $100,000 fine. Second offense is lose of their medical license. If that’s true (and I’ve every reason to believe it is), our government is giving doctors less benefit of the doubt than various criminals, who at least get a three-strike rule in their favor before the heavy consequences hit.</p></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Integration: How is life different? The same? Who am I now? Stage 6 of 7</h1><p>Does TBI Make Me a New Person?I have read that TBI causes us to become a new person. That is quite a stark statement. It startled me into realizing that I should not expect to be able to do what I used to. I have let go of my expectation, though not my desire, to be present in the same way I used to, to do the same things I used to, live life the same way I used to.</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/85ae7abf-746e-49bf-86cb-aa0dc1529da4.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Denial: This is NOT happening to me! Stage 1 of 7</h1><p>In its simplest form, denial finds us trying to convince ourselves that “this is not happening!” However, there are some very sly ways we can do this — all of which are futile attempts at controlling reality. One example comes from my own experience.</p></article>]]></description>
