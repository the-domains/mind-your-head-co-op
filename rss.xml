            <title><![CDATA[One Year Stick Free!]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>One Year Stick Free!</h1><p>Barbara, my wife, tells it this way: “One year ago today (11–25–2012, this was first published, 2013) we got back from Mass on Christ the King and you asked me to watch you. You leaned your sticks against the garage and took off. My instincts from years of having to catch you when you fall had me diving. But you kept going. Down the road. Past the bridge. Out of sight. Tears streamed down my cheeks as I watched you go.”</p></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Ketogenic Diet: Food for the Brain</h1><p>Ketogenic simply means getting your primary energy by burning fat, as opposed to most people in the US today who get most of their energy by burning glucose. Science is showing us that when fat is our primary fuel we function much smoother and healthier — including multiple studies showing brain benefits of burning fat os our primary fuel. In essence we access God’s engineering by shifting to burning fat rather than glucose.</p></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Exercise Helps Heal the Brain</h1><p>Exercise really does help heal the brain. One of the now known ways it does is by helping generate new mitochondria in the brain and throughout the nervous system. When mitochondria, the powerhouse within each cell of the body, get low neurons risk dysfunction or death. Running the Colorado Trail, along with all other forms of exercise, help heal my brain. What exercise do you find helps heal yours?</p></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Spend a Day on Planet TBI</h1><p>For those who want or need to understand what it is like (sort of) to be blind or deaf, that is relatively easy to accomplish. Block those senses. It doesn’t give an appreciation for what it is like to live without sight or sound day in and day out, but you get an excellent taste.</p></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Are your eyes covered? I need a drink.</h1><p>This is what my wife asked me last night as I was in bed. It seems absurd. Yet with brain injury it makes perfect sense, and it well illustrates what families with a brain injured person do all the time to accommodate their brain injured member.</p></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Adrenaline and Friends Half Life</h1><p>It was only a few years ago I began to understand more fully the extend of harm to my capacity adrenaline causes and just how long it takes to leave my system. I suspect most of us with bludgeoned brains feel the effects of adrenaline and friends (there is a slew of neurochemical stuff released that no one is really sure what all it does) without even realizing it for the simple reason that we are under constant bombardment from stimulation.</p></article>]]></description>
